            <p>Peace! My name is Davon, an upcoming Software Engineer who is a native resident of New York City. </p>

            <p>I began to engage with the web 3 ecosystem in late 2021. During that time, my observations of the social and economic impact of rapidly changing technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic
            also prompted my interest in the tech industry, with particular consideration for the challenges of those who are technologically disadvantaged. With this newfound enthusiasm, 
            I pivoted away from my experiences in the service, academic and literary sectors, and focused in being part of the tech ecosystem at large. </p>

            <p>Currently, I am a fellow with The Knowledge House (TKH) under the web development track. In this program, my aim is also an extension to one of my 
                never-ending goals: to deepen my understanding of the software engineering profession and to creatively build and improve digital products that contributes 
                to accessibility and utility of information to and for all.</p>
